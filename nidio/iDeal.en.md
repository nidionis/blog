## Constitution of Digital Values and Governance

Digital voting requires reliable systems, and computers remain a black box. The only true guarantee is a **manual verification**.

**Proposal:** Let each pair `"secret_identifier:choice"` be made public.  
Thus, each user can verify their own choices, without knowing to whom the others belong.

Although considered a flaw (less anonymity → potential pressure), I refuse any other alternative.

If the corruption rate does not change the outcome, then the decision is validated.

Is there a better compromise?

Considering that every group generates value, it might as well be measured in proportion to time.

Any group or project is called a **firm**.

Individuals and firms can found and join firms.

### Article 1 – Definitions, Token, and Principles of Value

**1.1** Entities: firms or individuals.  
**1.2** Any task between entities is measured in *token × time*. The tokens, stored on the blockchain, will be used to distribute the generated value according to defined modalities.  
**1.2.1** The generated value is relative, defined by internal contracts. It can be convertible into **USDT** through dependencies on recognized markets.  
**1.3** The use of the token is set in the firm’s **Terms of Use (CGU)**. It may, for example, be:  

- egalitarian (1 token per unit of time, i.e., one *denier*),  
- hierarchical (function of rank),  
- by graphs (complex ratios),  
- correlated to external indicators (median salary, average gross cost, etc.),  
- or other emerging models.  

**1.4** Each firm defines in its CGU its distribution system and the use of tokens. Conversion to external currency (e.g., USDT) is optional and managed by the firm.

### Article 2 – Contracts and Value Management

**2.1** Each firm manages and transfers value according to its model: simple (denier), complex (pyramidal, by graphs), or aligned with an external currency.  
**2.2** Any contract between entities must go through governance for validation.  
**2.3** Cases of non-confirmation (explicit or asymmetric refusals) must be specified in the contract.

### Article 3 – Governance and Collective Decisions

**3.0** Each vote shall follow the **Condorcet method** (the most optimized).  
**3.1** Collective decisions are administered by firms (owned by their members).  
**3.2** Each entity is identified by a hash of its public key.  
**3.3** For each vote, a voting key is derived from the entity’s private key.  
**3.4** Votes are published on the chain in the form `hashed_voting_public_key : votes`.  
**3.5** Vote cancellation or confirmation must remain technically discreet; this serves as a “second round.”  
**3.6** A decision is validated if the main choice retains the majority despite the cancelled votes, which are then counted as opposition.

### Article 4 – Identification, Communication, and Participation

**4.1** The identification of individuals (email address, in-person key delivery, biometrics, etc.) must be specified in the CGU.  
**4.2** Each individual must be reachable through a defined channel, with a mandatory acknowledgment of receipt within a maximum delay (automated acknowledgment allowed).  
**4.3** Inclusion and exclusion of entities are handled through governance. The selection of subjects submitted to vote remains at the firm’s discretion.  
**4.4** Firms can exist at any scale: self-employment, partnership, marriage, family, city, nation, etc.

**Cool Paradigm:**  
Decisions that are difficult to validate (cf. second round) enforce stronger consensus upstream.

Security via `private_id:choice` was inspired by **Anis Sajed**, and remains too little heard.
